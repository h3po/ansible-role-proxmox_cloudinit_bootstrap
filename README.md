h3po.proxmox_cloudinit_bootstrap
=========

:warning: This role is WIP and largely untested

This ansible role creates proxmox VMs from cloudinit-capable templates, such as the ones created by [h3po.proxmox_debian_cloudimage](https://github.com/h3po/ansible-role-proxmox-debian-cloudimage/).
It can edit basic parameters of the resulting VM such as CPU cores, memory and disk size and may add a freshly created ssh key for the initial connection.

Role Variables
--------------

Required variables
| variable | default value | description/alternatives
| --- | --- | --- |
| proxmox_vm_storage | local | the storage that the VM is cloned onto
| proxmox_bootstrap_user | bootstrap | the name of the user that is added to the VM
| proxmox_bootstrap_sshkey | random | the ssh key of the bootstrap user. if this is "random", a new key will be created for the first connection
| proxmox_cloudimage_template_vmid | | the id of the template to be cloned, usually set by the proxmox_debian_cloudimage role

Optional variables
| variable | default value | description/alternatives
| --- | --- | --- |
| proxmox_vm_pool | | the pool that the VM is added to
| proxmox_vm_node | | the node that the VM is cloned to. Only works when proxmox_vm_storage is a shared storage
| proxmox_cores_spec | | the number of cores
| proxmox_cpuunits_spec | | the cpu shares
| proxmox_memory_spec | | the memory size in MB
| proxmox_balloon_spec | | the minimum memory size in MB with ballooning
| proxmox_memory_shares_spec | | the memory shares for ballooning
| proxmox_bridge_device_spec | | the bridge for the net0 interface
| proxmox_bridge_device_ipaddr | | the ip address for the net0 interface
| proxmox_bridge_device_gw | | the default gateway for the net0 interface
| proxmox_bridge_vlan_spec | | the vlan tag for the net0 interface
| proxmox_disk_spec | | the disk size in proxmox notation, e.g. '10G'. The role will grow the root partition and filesystem to fill the enlarged disk
| proxmox_nameserver | | DNS server IP address for the VM.
| proxmox_bridge_device_spec | | DNS search domain for the VM.

If the optional variables are not defined, then no change is made to the VM and it will keep the inherited settings of the template.

Example Playbook
----------------

Here's an example including the [h3po.proxmox_debian_cloudimage](https://github.com/h3po/ansible-role-proxmox-debian-cloudimage/) role to create the template and then clone it to 'new-debian-vm'. The detection of wether the VM already exists or not depends on the variable `proxmox_vmid` set by the proxmox inventory plugin from the [community.general](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general) collection.
